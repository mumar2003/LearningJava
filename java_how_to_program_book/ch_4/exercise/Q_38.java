   4.38 .
   (Factorial) The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written as n!
   (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined for values of n greater than or
    equal to 1 as:
       n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)....1
   and for the n value 0 as:
       n!=1
   For example,5!=5*4*3*2*1      which is 120.

1. Write an application that reads a nonnegative integer and
   computes and prints its factorial.

2. Write an application that estimates the value of the mathematical
   constant e by using the following formula. Allow the user to
   enter the number of terms to calculate.
       e^x=(1/1!)+(2/2!)+(3/3!)+......

3. Write an application that computes the value of
   by using the (e^x) following formula. Allow the user to enter the number of terms to
   calculate.
      e^x=(x/1!)+(x^2/2!)+(x^3/3!)+......
