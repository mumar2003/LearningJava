4.32 (Printing the Decimal Equivalent of a Binary Number) Write an
     application that inputs an integer containing only 0s and 1s (i.e., a binary
     integer) and prints its decimal equivalent. [Hint: Use the remainder and
     division operators to pick off the binary numberâ€™s digits one at a time,
     from right to left. In the decimal number system, the rightmost digit has a
     positional value of 1 and the next digit to the left a positional value of 10,
     then 100, then 1000, and so on. The decimal number 234 can be
     interpreted as 4 * 1 + 3 * 10 + 2 * 100. In the binary number system, the
     rightmost digit has a positional value of 1, the next digit to the left a
     positional value of 2, then 4, then 8, and so on. The decimal equivalent of
     binary 1101 is 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8, or 1 + 0 + 4 + 8 or, 13.]
